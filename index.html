                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p>NYC Parks is pleased to announce the installation of caesura: a forum, a collaborative architectural and sound installation by artist Jessica Feldman and architects Jerome W Haferd & K Brandt Knapp. The installation will be on view between June 20 and October 31, 2015 on the Acropolis at Marcus Garvey Park, a central Harlem park with a rich history in civic engagement, music, and performance.</p>
                <p>cae•su•ra: a forum is inspired by Marcus Garvey Park’s iconic antebellum Fire Watchtower & Bell, and by Harlem’s vibrant tradition of activism and rallies. The bell is silent now, as the tower was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction. Simultaneously, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and New York City is experiencing a resurgence of public culture. caesura seeks to temporarily fill an architectural gap – and create a social space – by echoing and inverting the form and function of the absent tower. Like the bell, caesura aims to call up the neighborhood, to preserve and revitalize Harlem’s histories, and to connect newer and older community members to each other, by reactivating this site for congregation, viewing, and listening. The installation will reframe history with a temporary structure and sound. A “caesura” is a break or pause, a place to catch your breath, most specifically in ancient spoken-word art. </p>
                <p>A prominent feature of Marcus Garvey Park and its neighborhood, the Mount Morris Fire Watchtower serves as an important community landmark. 19th century efforts to contain fire included round-the-clock watchmen at strategic vantage points. These men directed fire companies through an alarm code, corresponding to the severity of the fire and to numbered districts, transmitted by bells, flags and lanterns. The tower was designated a New York City landmark in 1967 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Through the support of the Marcus Garvey Park Conservancy and the Manhattan Borough President, Parks undertook a major stabilization of the structure in 1994. The Marcus Garvey Park Fire Watchtower was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction. The restoration design is currently under development, and the restoration of the tower is expected to be completed in 2017.</p>

                <h4>Architecture</h4>
                <p>The architectural component of this piece begins at the acropolis’ ground as an open air, steel frame, which supports a “horizontal tower” figuration, that the viewer can pass through and meander under. In the center of the piece, the “bell” made of mirrored steel reflects the sky to the south, where the tower stood, and the expansive view to the north of the city. Above, the rectilinear, exterior skeleton of the horizontal figure becomes a curvaceous form on the interior when the inhabitant looks up. The double-curved surfaces are seen through film tape, linear tubes and profiles of steel. Light and air movements dynamically open, pattern and break from the undulating form. Sonically, the skin resonates with voices and music and the “bell” rings with rhythm and chime by use of electromagnetic transducers attached in the fabric and on the steel. New and old histories recorded, spliced and digitally scripted together, activate the acropolis and pause throughout the day. listening . gathering . voicing .</p>

                <h4>Sound</h4>
                <p>The sonic component of the piece consists of Feldman’s interactive composition, made up of bell sounds and voices. Historical and contemporary recordings and live-streaming voices from speeches, rallies, chants, and assemblies in Harlem are alternated with a through-composed layer of echoing bells. These sounds play and pause throughout the day, making acoustic space for participation and assembly. Analogous to a megaphone, the formal profile of the tower has been tipped sideways, allowing sound to be projected outward. Taut, translucent film runs through this shape and is mounted with electromagnetic transducers that turn the material into a speaker, allowing sound to pour down from the spaces in between the arches above visitors. Transducers mounted inside the mirrored steel plate, standing in for the absent bell, resonate occasionally with Feldman’s composition of recorded bell sounds. The mirrored steel plate emits sounds composed of the reverberations of bells. A microphone mounted at the entrance to the installation allows visitors to broadcast their own voices through the piece. Those not present can participate through an interactive online component, allowing them to trigger the bell and contribute their own live audio to the arches. New and old histories are recorded, spliced, and digitally scripted together, activating the acropolis throughout the day.</p>
